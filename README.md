## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- google fonts family ``outfit``



### What I learned

I learned a lot from this challenge, particularly how to center content both vertically and horizontally thanks to the grid.

look at the code below ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡, it only took me 2 lines to center my content unlike flex boxes


```css
body {
	display: grid;
	place-items: center;
	background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
	height: 100vh;
	font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
}
```



### Continued development

I would like to easily have imagination for the design of my future web pages. create incredible designs in just a few lines of code.


### Useful resources

- [google fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com) - This resource allowed me to find and adapt the appropriate font to my design.
